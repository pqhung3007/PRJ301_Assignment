## Details

### Build with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript ES6
- Bootstrap
- JSP Servlet

### What I learned

:white_check_mark: I've been putting a lot of work towards understanding how a Servlet works behind the screen (request processing, GET/POST methods).

:white_check_mark: But most importantly, I've learned how to set up a flow for a fullstack web app, from building the UI to making requests to backend.

:white_check_mark: What's more, I have successfully applied JS Intersection Observer API to make sections smoothly appear on scroll. I may try to make this website more animated in the future. :+1:
